/**
 * This Logger should be unified with `core/src/logger.ts`. The main difference
 * is that the CLI logger has internal handling on JSON/VERBOSE modes, but
 * does not implement per-module logging and debug levels.
 *
 * There are four modes of operation:
 * - Regular (both JSON and VERBOSE modes are off)
 * - JSON mode (JSON mode is on, VERBOSE mode is off)
 * - verbose mode (JSON mode is off, VERBOSE mode is on)
 * - verbose JSON mode (JSON and VERBOSE modes are on)
 *
 * Generally, we want to hide debug logs unless verbose mode is on,
 * and during JSON mode, we want to ensure no logs end up in stdout,
 * because we assume the user might be piping the output to a JSON parser.
 * However, during verbose JSON mode, we want to keep debug information
 * without breaking the JSON output, so we redirect all logs to stderr.
