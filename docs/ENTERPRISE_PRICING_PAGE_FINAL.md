Why Infrastructure Matters
```

We do not promise that Google will index everything.

We promise that we will never scale blindly.

This is why SEO Infrastructure is included — not optional.
```

SEO Infrastructure is included in all Enterprise plans.

Because without it, scaling would be irresponsible.
```

Enterprise-Grade Reliability
```

### 列表

```
• Automated health checks before every deployment
• Database-level constraints prevent broken sitemaps

• Full audit trail for compliance requirements
• Kill-switch tested and ready
```

---

## Section 8：CTA

```
Ready to scale AI content without risking your brand?

## 销售话术（反质疑版）

### 质疑 1："AI 生成这么多页面，不会被 Google 打击吗？"

```
这是为什么我们把 SEO 当成基础设施，而不是内容问题。

我们不追求"生成多少"，我们只允许"在 Index Rate 健康的情况下扩容"。

一旦 Google 停止索引，系统会自动冻结扩容。

关键词：automatically freeze
```

### 质疑 2："你们怎么知道 Google 到底收没收录？"

```
We don't trust screenshots.

We track the full pipeline:
Discovered → Crawled → Indexed, every day.

If Indexed doesn't grow, scaling stops.
```

### 质疑 3："如果 SEO 出问题，会不会影响我们业务交付？"

```
No. SEO and delivery are isolated systems.

Batch API and credits are not affected by indexing issues.

SEO failures never block enterprise delivery.
```

### 质疑 4："那你们和普通 AI SEO 工具最大的区别是什么？"

```
Most tools generate content.
We control whether Google will index it at scale.

（停 1 秒）

That's the difference between a tool and infrastructure.
```

### 质疑 5："这个能力是加钱的吗？"

```
No.

SEO Infrastructure is included in all Enterprise plans.

Because without it, scaling would be irresponsible.
```
