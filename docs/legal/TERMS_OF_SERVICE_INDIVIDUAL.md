### 1. Operator Information

Sora2 is operated by an individual developer ("Operator"). The Services are provided on a best-effort basis and are not offered by a registered legal entity at this stage.

By using Sora2, you acknowledge that you are transacting with an individual operator, not a corporation or registered business entity.

Services may include, but are not limited to:

- AI video generation
- AI content generation
- Batch processing (preview)
- Index health monitoring (preview)
- SEO-related tooling (preview)

Features labeled as "Preview," "Beta," or "Experimental" are subject to change, limitation, or discontinuation at any time.

**3.1 Payment Model**

All payments are one-time, prepaid purchases processed through Stripe. There are no recurring subscriptions unless explicitly offered and agreed to.

- Credits are non-transferable between accounts
- Credits are non-refundable, unless otherwise required by applicable law

Such actions do not constitute a breach of service, failure to perform, or grounds for refund claims.

These features:
