## Clause: SEO & Indexing Risk Responsibility

### 1. No Indexing Guarantee

**No Guarantee of Indexing**

The Customer acknowledges that search engine indexing, ranking, and visibility are determined solely by third-party search engines (including but not limited to Google, Bing, and other search providers).

Sora2 does not guarantee that any specific page, content, or URL will be indexed, ranked, or maintained in search results.

Search engine algorithms, policies, and behaviors are subject to change without notice and are outside the control of Sora2.

---

### 2. SEO Infrastructure Commitment

**SEO Infrastructure Commitment**

Sora2 provides enterprise-grade SEO infrastructure designed to monitor, control, and reduce indexing risk, including but not limited to:

- **Index health monitoring**: Daily tracking of Discovered, Crawled, and Indexed metrics
- **Sitemap integrity validation**: Automatic detection of empty or malformed sitemaps
- **Automated scaling controls**: Expansion freeze when Index Rate falls below defined thresholds
- **Risk alerts and operational safeguards**: Real-time notifications of potential SEO issues

These mechanisms are intended to prevent silent SEO failures during large-scale content expansion and represent Sora2's commitment to responsible SEO operations.

---

### 3. Automatic Scaling Control

**Automatic Scaling Control**

In the event that Sora2's index health metrics indicate elevated SEO risk (including but not limited to Index Rate falling below 40%, detection of empty sitemap chunks, or sustained zero index growth), Sora2 reserves the right to automatically suspend or limit further content scaling activities in order to protect the Customer's domain, brand, and search visibility.

Such suspension shall not be considered a service failure, breach of contract, or grounds for service credit claims.

The Customer agrees that such protective measures are in the Customer's best interest and acknowledges that resumption of scaling activities will occur when index health metrics return to acceptable levels.

---

### 4. Risk Isolation from Core Services

**Risk Isolation**

SEO-related risk controls shall not affect the availability, performance, or delivery of Sora2's core services, including but not limited to:

- Batch APIs and content generation workloads
- Credit-based usage and billing
- Video generation and processing services
- API access and integrations

Unless otherwise explicitly agreed in writing, SEO infrastructure operates independently from core delivery systems, ensuring that SEO-related pauses do not impact the Customer's production workloads.

---

### 5. Customer Acknowledgement of Trade-offs

**Acknowledgement of Trade-offs**

The Customer acknowledges that:

1. Safe scaling may require limiting, delaying, or rolling back certain SEO-related activities
2. Maximum content generation volume does not equal maximum indexing or search visibility
3. Sora2's conservative approach to scaling is designed to protect long-term domain health

The Customer agrees that such actions are necessary trade-offs to reduce long-term search and brand risk and shall not constitute a breach of service level agreements.

---

### 6. Limitation of Liability (SEO Scope)

**Limitation of Liability (SEO Scope)**

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Sora2 shall not be liable for:

- Any loss of search traffic, rankings, or search visibility
- Any loss of revenue, business opportunities, or goodwill arising from search engine decisions
- Any SEO-related outcomes resulting from search engine algorithm changes, policy updates, or indexing decisions
- Any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages related to search engine performance

This limitation applies regardless of whether such damages were foreseeable or whether Sora2 was advised of the possibility of such damages.

---

### 7. Customer Responsibilities

**Customer Responsibilities**

The Customer agrees to:

1. Review and act upon SEO alerts and recommendations provided by Sora2
2. Not circumvent or disable SEO safety mechanisms without written agreement from Sora2
3. Provide accurate information about their SEO strategy, target markets, and risk tolerance
4. Maintain appropriate expectations regarding search engine behavior and indexing timelines

---

### 8. Mutual Good Faith

**Mutual Good Faith**

Both parties agree to operate in good faith regarding SEO-related matters, including:

- Transparent communication about index health metrics and concerns
- Collaborative problem-solving when SEO issues arise
- Reasonable accommodation of each party's business needs and risk profiles

---

## Summary Statement（合同总结句）

```
Sora2 commits to responsible SEO operations, not guaranteed search outcomes.
