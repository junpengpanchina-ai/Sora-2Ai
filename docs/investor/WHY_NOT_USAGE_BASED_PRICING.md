Why Sora2 Does Not Use Usage-Based Pricing for Enterprise
```

## The Problem with Usage-Based Pricing

### What Looks Good on Paper

- Pay per page generated
- Pay per video created
- Pay per token consumed

### What Breaks at Scale

| Issue | Why It's a Problem |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Incentivizes blind expansion** | More usage = more revenue, even if harmful |
| **Rewards quantity over safety** | No brake pedal on risky scaling |
| **Pushes risk to vendor after damage** | Customer pays first, complains later |

### The Core Conflict

```
Usage-based pricing encourages over-generation before validation.
```

## SEO Risk is Non-Linear

### Why Per-Page Pricing Doesn't Work for SEO

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| **One bad rollout affects entire domain** | Not just the pages you generated |
| **Risk is shared across all pages** | Domain authority is collective |
| **Damage appears after usage is paid** | You've already collected the money |

### The Timing Problem

```
Customer pays for 10,000 pages
→ Google stops indexing at page 3,000
→ Customer blames you
→ But you've already been paid for "successful" generation
```

**Usage-based pricing = misaligned incentives**

## Sora2's Pricing Logic

### Risk-Based Enterprise Pricing

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Fixed pricing | Aligned with risk ownership |
| Scaling gated | By index health, not payment |
| Vendor incentives | Aligned with long-term success |

### Why This Works

```
We don't monetize volume.
We monetize responsibility.
```

---

## Comparison Table

| | Usage-Based | Risk-Based (Sora2) |
|---|-------------|-------------------|
| **Revenue driver** | More pages = more money | Safe scaling = retention |
| **When customer over-generates** | We profit | We stop them |
| **Incentive alignment** | Short-term volume | Long-term health |
| **Who owns risk** | Customer (after paying) | Shared responsibility |
| **What we optimize for** | Generation volume | Index success rate |

---

## The Key Insight

### If We Charged Per Page

```
We'd be incentivized to let customers over-generate.
Our model only works if we stop them when it's unsafe.
```

### Our Model Requires

- Saying "no" to more revenue when scaling is risky
- Freezing expansion even when customer wants to pay more
- Prioritizing domain health over billing

**This is impossible with usage-based pricing.**

## Investor Objections & Responses

### Q: "Doesn't this limit your revenue upside?"

```
A: It limits short-term volume, but increases:
   - Customer retention (they don't get burned)
   - Expansion revenue (they scale safely over time)
   - Enterprise credibility (we're not a volume shop)
```

### Q: "What if competitors undercut you with usage pricing?"

```
A: Let them.
   Our customers are buying risk management, not cheap pages.
   Customers who want cheap volume aren't our market.
```

### Q: "How do you grow revenue then?"

```
A: Three vectors:
   1. More Enterprise customers
   2. Tier upgrades (Core → Scale)
   3. Safe expansion within existing customers
   
   All aligned with customer success.
```

## The Fundamental Truth

```
Usage-based pricing works for tools.
Risk-based pricing works for infrastructure.
```

### We Are Infrastructure

- We don't just generate content
- We manage the risk of scaling content
- Our value is in the guardrails, not the volume

## Summary Statement

```
"We don't price by usage. We price by risk ownership."
```
