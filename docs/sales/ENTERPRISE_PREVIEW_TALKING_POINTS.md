# Enterprise Demo 话术 - Preview 版本

> **适用场景**：个人身份运营时的 Enterprise 对话
> **核心姿态**：已有 Enterprise 能力，但以 Preview 形式提供

---

## 核心定位

```
"We're already operating at Enterprise standards.
We're just not forcing Enterprise contracts too early."
```

---

## 开场话术

### 当客户问 "你们有 Enterprise 吗？"

**❌ 不要说：**
- "We offer Enterprise contracts"
- "We guarantee SLA"
- "We have MSA ready to sign"

**✅ Preview 版回答：**

```
Currently, Sora2 operates on a prepaid credits model.

For teams that are scaling seriously, we provide Enterprise-level capabilities in preview.
```

---

## 讲解 Infrastructure 时

### 原来的 Enterprise 话术

```
"Our Enterprise plan guarantees..."
```

### Preview 版替换

```
"What you're seeing here is our Enterprise-grade infrastructure, 
currently available in preview for selected teams."
```

---

## 讲解 Dashboard 时

### Preview 版话术

```
"This dashboard is how we internally operate and protect large-scale usage.

Selected customers get access to this on a preview basis."
```

### 强调点

```
"We built this for ourselves first — to make sure scaling doesn't break things.

Now we're making it available to teams who take scaling seriously."
```

---

## 讲解 SEO Infrastructure 时

### Preview 版话术

```
"The SEO monitoring and scaling controls you see here are operating right now.

They're not a promise for a future plan — they're how we actually run the system.

For teams with serious scaling needs, we provide access to these on a preview basis."
```

---

## 被问 "那现在能买吗？"

### 标准答案（非常重要）

```
"At this stage, Enterprise features are available case by case.

We start with credits, validate fit, and then discuss a formal Enterprise arrangement."
```

### 补充（如果客户很认真）

```
"What I can do is set you up with credits to start.

If we see a good fit after a few weeks, we can talk about a more structured arrangement."
```

---

## 被问 "你们有合同吗？"

### Preview 版回答

```
"We're currently operating as an individual developer with a prepaid credits model.

For teams that need formal contracts, we discuss that as part of a potential Enterprise arrangement.

But honestly — most teams start with credits first to validate fit."
```

---

## 被问 "你们有公司吗？"

### 诚实但专业的回答

```
"Sora2 is currently operated by me as an individual developer.

The systems, infrastructure, and operational standards are Enterprise-grade — 
that's how I built it from day one.

Formal company registration happens when the scale and customer needs require it."
```

---

## 被问 "那我怎么信任你？"

### 信任建立话术

```
"Fair question. Here's how I think about it:

1. Everything is prepaid — you control how much you put in
2. The infrastructure is real — I can show you the dashboard
3. The scaling controls protect both of us — I don't want broken SEO either

Start small. See how it works. Then decide if you want to go bigger."
```

---

## 终极收尾句

### 当客户表示有兴趣但犹豫时

```
"Here's my honest take:

I've built this to Enterprise standards because I plan to scale it.

You're getting access to that infrastructure early, at a lower commitment level.

If it works, we grow together. If not, you've only risked a small amount of credits."
```

---

## 筛选客户的话术

### 当客户只想便宜时

```
"If you're looking for the cheapest option, we're probably not the right fit.

What we offer is safe scaling — that's what you're paying for."
```

### 当客户需要合同但你还没公司时

```
"I understand you need formal contracts for procurement.

At this stage, I'm not able to provide that.

What I can offer is a lower-commitment way to validate fit first.

If it makes sense, we can discuss formal arrangements later."
```

---

## FAQ 话术

### Q: "Preview 是什么意思？"

```
"It means the capability is real and operational, 
but the formal packaging (contracts, SLAs) isn't finalized yet.

You're getting early access to Enterprise-grade infrastructure."
```

### Q: "Preview 会变吗？"

```
"Yes, features may evolve. 

But the core infrastructure — index monitoring, scaling controls — 
those are stable because I depend on them too."
```

### Q: "什么时候会有正式 Enterprise？"

```
"When there's enough demand and the right customers.

Right now, I'd rather build relationships with serious users 
than rush to sell contracts."
```

---

## 一句话总结（给自己的提醒）

```
"你不是在'卖 Enterprise'，
你是在'筛选未来的 Enterprise 客户'。"
```
